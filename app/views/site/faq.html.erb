<h3>Shipping & Delivery</h3>
<br />
<h4>What type of packaging do you use?</h4>
<p>Posters and art prints are rolled with thick paper to protect against dust before being packaged in tubes or in corrugated triangular shipping containers. Framed items are covered securely and placed in adjustable corrugated inserts that lock the frame in position.</p>
<h4>When will my art arrive?</h4>
<p>You can estimate your art's arrival by adding the processing and transit times. See Details.</p>
<h4>How do I track my order?</h4>
<p>You can quickly check the status of a current order with your order number and email address. As soon as your art ships, we'll send you a confirmation email that includes a tracking number.</p>
<h4>How much will shipping cost?</h4>
<p>Shipping fees vary based on the quantity and type of art you've ordered. See our shipping rates chart to estimate your charges.</p>
<h4>Is my package insured?</h4>
<p>Art.com guarantees your satisfaction and we will give you a refund or a replacement for purchased items you are not satisfied with. In the remote event that your package is lost or damaged upon arrival, please contact our Customer Support Team at +44 20 7183 1900 or by email.</p>

<h3>Ordering</h3>
<br />
<h4>How do I place an order?</h4>
<p>Add the product(s) you wish to order in your shopping cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button located next to the product image. When you're ready to complete your order, click "Continue Checkout" from within your cart and follow the instructions. You may also complete your order by calling us at +44 20 7183 1900.</p>

<h4>What payment options do you accept?</h4>
<p>We accept all major credit cards, including Visa/Visa Electron, Mastercard/Eurocard and American Express. We also accept PayPal.</p>
<h4>Can I cancel my order?</h4>
<p>To cancel an order that has not yet shipped, have your order number available and contact our Customer Support Team at +44 20 7183 1900 or by emailing support@art.com. We are unable to process cancellations for items that have already shipped. Please visit our returns page or contact us for alternate options.
We are unable to add additional items to existing orders or substitute individual items. You will need to cancel your existing order and place a new one. Thanks for your patience!</p>
<h4>When will my credit card be billed?</h4>
<p>Prior to shipping, we have only received a pending pre-authorization request from your financial institution. When we request an authorization for your purchase, your financial institution may place a hold on your account for the amount of that pre-authorization request. While your financial institution may place a hold on the pre-authorized amount, your account will only be charged for the actual transaction amount when the first item on the order is shipped. Any pending refunds will process when all items have shipped.</p>
<p>Most financial institutions will remove a pre-authorization hold from your account when the actual transaction amount is debited from your account or 3-5 business days after the pre-authorization request, whichever occurs sooner. Since policies vary between different financial institutions, we recommend that you contact your financial institution with any further questions about a pre-authorization. Art.com will not release pre-authorization holds.</p>
<h4>Does the image on your site accurately represent what I will be sent?</h4>
<p>We strive for a high degree of image accuracy. However, in some cases, the visual representation may be approximate, or prints may vary. If you are not satisfied with the product you receive, you may return it within 30 days for a refund.</p>
